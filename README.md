# TOH_Client
Actionscript Client for Town of Heggen

2017 IT project for highschool.
Teacher did not know what a 'class' is, so decided that I would get a minus grade for it.
Sad since I made a server and the networking for it to work for PC and Android.

Spent a lot of time on this, many hours debugging the ill-documented Actionscript 3 language. No Mr. Actionscript3 Bible - AC3 does in fact NOT flush the buffer upon write, this must be done manual.

The code is supposed to be GPLv3, however, flashplayer is a proprietary mess, soo license is just open.
Use it for what you want. No guarantees.
The project code was upgraded from CS5 to Adobe Animate in 2020 - and it works.

It has Android mobile (touch) support.
It checks if you have touch input enabled, if so; it enables the GUI for touch.

Since this was before I had learned software engineering the code is very much spaghetti.
