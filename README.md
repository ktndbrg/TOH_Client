# TOH_Client
Actionscript Client for Town of Heggen

IT project for highschool.
Teacher did not understand jack-shit of the code.
Didn't even know what a 'class' is.
Got a bad grade bcuz of it.
Even made a server for it, and it works on android. Still not impressed.

The code is supposed to be GPLv3, however, flashplayer is a proprietary mess, soo license is just open.
Use it for what you want. No guarantees.

It has Android mobile support.
It checks if you have touch input enabled, if so; it enables the GUI for touch.
Code is a mess/spaghetti.
